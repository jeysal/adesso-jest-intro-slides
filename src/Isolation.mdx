# Isolation

<span style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace' }}>index.js</span>

```js
const sideEffect = () => (window.counter = (window.counter || 0) + 1);

export default sideEffect;
```

<span style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace' }}>index.test.js</span>

```js
import sideEffect from '.';

test('returns 1 on the first call', () => {
  expect(sideEffect()).toBe(1);
});
```

</Slide>

<Notes>

another typical issue with scaling is isolation

example: function with side effect that writes to a global

Jest runs each of your test files in a new JS VM context, so if this function is called in another test file as well, the test will still pass

obviously you shouldn't write code like this anyway,
but in reality issues like this are often very hidden and subtle and Jest helps you avoid them

of course this cannot help you with accessing other common resources such as the FS from multiple tests
