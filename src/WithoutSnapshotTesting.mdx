<Notes>

probably heard about, even if you haven't used: snapshot testing

this really got popularized by Jest, pretty much wasn't a thing before Jest came around.

use case e.g.: function that renders text by putting it in a DOM element with a bit of styling

now we want to test there's a proper margin applied to the element

but we don't really know what the exact top right bottom left margin values are, a pixel or a rem or .9?

also don't really care, as long as it's a reasonable value for the text.

without snapshot testing, might look at what it prints and then copy that over

that's an annoying manual process, has to be done everytime we change the margin by like 10%
