JS ecosys known, sometimes notorious for fragmentation and
need to use and configure ten different tools to work together

This is the Jest website

It says Jest "works out of the box" and "has the entire toolkit in one place"

While the variety of tools is certainly not always bad, turns out it actually makes a lot of sense for a test runner to also handle some things a module bundler usually handles, such as dependency resolution

In this talk we'll look at some of the out-of-the-box features that make Jest unique

Play around with gimmick
