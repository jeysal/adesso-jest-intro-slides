<Notes>

nice out of the box features;
but real killer feature: the watch mode

launch Jest with `--watch`, does ... nothing

because we're in a Git repo & don't have any changed files.
But Jest is now watching the FS for changes, so if we make a change to subtract.js...

only runs the subtract test, b/c add.test does not depend on subtract.js, so Jest actually analyzes the dependencies between files here

if we change add.js it'll rerun both; depend on add directly / transitively

actually the first time we see a test failure printed,
pretty nice with the code frame and everything

may have also seen instructions down here,
a whole bunch of interactive things in watch mode,
pretty nice in daily development workflow

show only failed tests, file name pattern

community! typeahead, toggle coverage, etc.
