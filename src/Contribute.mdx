<Notes>

If you've used Jest a bit and agree that it is awesome, consider contributing!

started by FB, but now mostly community-maintained

very diverse codebase, list of individual packages that Jest is made of on the left, from low-level dependency graphs and module resolution to high-level reporting UI

it's not just an arbitrary internal structuring, I've actually used some of these packages directly, e.g. pretty-format, jest-diff). jest-worker is also really nice for parallelizing heavy workloads

On the right, my first Jest PR, well, first one that got merged - this was not even really specific to Jest, but just support for a standard API added to Jest

So if you ever have a free evening, feel free to do the same as I did, pick an issue that sounds interesting, perhaps look for the "help wanted" label and have a go :)
