<Notes>

Snapshot testing provides a way to automate this process.

instead of asserting specific value, tell Jest to snapshot this

automatically writes snapshot into the test => check that it's good and commit

if the value ever changes, Jest will fail the test => nice diff and the option to update the snapshot if correct. Then commit and send for code review.

may be wondering about 'inline' - classic way to do snapshots writes to a file that is then checked in.

=> Large snapshots, don't want to mess up the test readability

But careful with large snapshots and snapshots in general, has use cases, but not a silver bullet

easy to overuse and make tests overly specific, wanna be able to review changes
