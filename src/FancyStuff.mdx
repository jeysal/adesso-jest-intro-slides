<Notes>

And all of this was just the stuff that comes out of the box.

If you have a large project and invest some time configuring Jest, you can get even more out of it.

For example, in my last project, we had this huge multi-project setup.

In watch mode you can see the community-built typeahead mentioned earlier.

Jest could also do the linting as well, this is TSLint running and reporting right in Jest alongside the tests

Select individually which of your projects you want to test and they all run in one Jest instance

And in general it's just really nice to run tests of so many subprojects at once, frontend, backend, shared stuff, everything
