<Notes>

let's start by setting up an almost empty project

only thing I've added here is Babel, which is the de-facto standard compiler for modern JS, and just configured it to allow us to use the latest version of JS

we add the Jest dependency, this brings a lot of things out of the box

many simple projects won't need any Jest config

if we were to add config, we can do that with a jest key next to the babel one, or of course in a config file
