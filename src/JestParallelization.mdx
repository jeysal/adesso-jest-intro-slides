<Notes>

Now of course another thing you've got to take care of if you want to deploy Jest at scale is parallelization

Once you hit a certain threshold, Jest will automatically start running your tests in parallel

This is done by spawning worker processes depending on the #CPUs

And also Jest is really smart about parallelization, for instance it'll remember how long your tests each take and run the slowest ones first -> explain optimization
